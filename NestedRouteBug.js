In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component nested inside a route defined with the `useRoutes` hook.  If the parent route's path doesn't match the nested route's expected parameter structure, `useParams` will return an empty object, even if the URL contains the expected parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors, particularly when accessing parameters directly from the empty object.
