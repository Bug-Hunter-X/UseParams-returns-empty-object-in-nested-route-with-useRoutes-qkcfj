This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to the `useParams` hook in React Router v6 when used within nested routes defined using `useRoutes`. The bug occurs when the parent route's path structure doesn't perfectly match the nested route's expected parameters, causing `useParams` to return an empty object.  The solution involves carefully aligning the parent and nested route paths to ensure correct parameter extraction.  The example uses a simple blog post scenario to illustrate the problem.
